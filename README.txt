1. Change directory to src in terminal.

2. Using the following commands to compile the necessary files.
	
		$ javac basic/*.java
		$ javac superTTT/*.java
		$ javac gameplay/*.java

	NOTE: To play a basic version of Tic-Tac-Toe use the command: $ java gameplay.Test basic
	
3. Run the program using the command:

		$ java gameplay.Test super
		
4. Follow the instructions to play the Game!
